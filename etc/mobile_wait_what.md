# Wait, Redpoint Works On Mobile??
Yeah, it does!

## Support
You should at minimum be running Android 10. Sorry IOS dudes, but this won't work for you.

## How Do I Install It?
- First, download [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).
- Next, follow the instructions [here](https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/nethunter-rootless/) to install Kali Linux on Termux, a Debian-based linux distro.
- Finally, follow the instructions to download & install redpoint on Debian-based systems, [here](https://github.com/13-05/redpoint/tree/redpoint-cpp#linux-debian--debian-based)!

# RedPoint [![Cyber - Stuff](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cyber-Stuff-indianred)](https://13-05.github.io)
Have you ever wanted a tool to exploit multiple services? A single program to perform all the cool programming stuff you need? Well, that's what RedPoint aims to be.

## About
RedPoint rose from my need of a better, more stable, and more powerful version of [dsc.red](https://github.com/13-05/discord.RED). So, I archived *dsc.red*, and started from scratch. One command at a time.

## What's With the Name, Anyway?
- `redpoint`: a cooler name alternative for `dsc.red` I had lying around.
- `.tool`: it's a multitool!

## Current Commands
1) Discord Webhook Spammer
2) Discord Webhook Deleter
3) Discord UserID Lookup Tool
4) Discord Account Disabler
5) Discord Token Checker
6) Discord Nitro Bruteforcer

## TODOs
1) Discord Token Logger Generator
2) Discord Commandline Client Mode
3) Discord Token Lookup (gathers info on someone by their token)
4) Discord Server Cloner

## Use
Download node_modules, package.json, package-lock.json, and index.js into a folder, then open command prompt, run "cd /folderpathtofile", then run "node index.js"
If the command fails you probably need to [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## The Future
I'll add as many features as I can to this thing, so stay tuned!

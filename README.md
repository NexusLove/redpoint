# RedPoint [![Cyber - Stuff](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cyber-Stuff-indianred)](https://13-05.github.io)
Have you ever wanted a tool to exploit multiple services? A single program to perform all the cool programming stuff you need? Well, that's what RedPoint aims to be.

## About
RedPoint rose from my need of a better, more stable, and more powerful version of [dsc.red](https://github.com/13-05/discord.RED). So, I archived *dsc.red*, and started from scratch. One command at a time.

## What's With the Name, Anyway?
- `redpoint`: a cooler name alternative for `dsc.red` I had lying around.
- `.m`: mobile; it works on multiple platforms, and is optimized for mobile!
- `.tool`: it's a multitool!

## Current Commands
1) Discord Webhook Spammer
2) Discord Webhook Deleter
3) Discord UserID Lookup Tool
4) Discord Account Disabler
5) Discord Token Checker
6) Discord Nitro Bruteforcer
7) Discord ANSI Codeblock Gen
8) Generic Webpage Cloner
9) Reverse IPV4 Lookup Tool (relies on [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com))
10) Image Search Tool
11) Current Crypto Prices
12) [pastie.io](https://pastie.io) Paste CLI Interface (kinda crappy lmfao)

## TODOs
1) Discord Token Logger Generator
2) Discord Commandline Client Mode
3) Discord Token Lookup (gathers info on someone by their token)
4) Discord Server Cloner

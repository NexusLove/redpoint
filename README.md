## Use

> cd redpoint
> npm start
```
If the `node index.js` fails, run `sudo apt install npm`.

## Special Notes
To get an authentication ticket, you need to go to the discord login page, then enter your password & email. When it shows the 2fa screen, open the network tab of the inspect element page (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` or `Fn` + `Shift` + `I` on most browsers). Then enter anything into the text box and hit enter. As shown below, click on the payload for totp and copy the ticket. Then you can use that in redpoint!

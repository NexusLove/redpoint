# RedPoint [![Cyber - Stuff](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cyber-Stuff-indianred)](https://13-05.github.io)
Have you ever wanted a tool to exploit multiple services? A single program to perform all the cool programming stuff you need? Well, that's what RedPoint aims to be.

## About
RedPoint rose from my need of a better, more stable, and more powerful version of [dsc.red](https://github.com/13-05/discord.RED). So, I archived *dsc.red*, and started from scratch. One command at a time.

## Current Commands
1) Discord Webhook Spammer
2) Discord Webhook Deleter
3) Discord UserID Lookup Tool
4) Discord Account Disabler
5) Generic Webpage Cloner
6) Reverse IPV4 Lookup Tool (relies on [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com))

## Other Commands I Might Add Soon; I at Least Have the Idea Down.
1) Discord Token Logger Generator
2) Reverse Image Search CLI
3) Discord Commandline Client Mode
4) Discord Token Lookup (gathers info on someone by their token)

## Other Stuff To Note
RedPoint automatically notifies you of any updates :D

## The Future
I'll add as many features as I can to this thing, so stay tuned!

# RedPoint [![Cyber - Stuff](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cyber-Stuff-indianred)](https://13-05.github.io)
Have you ever wanted a tool to exploit multiple services? A single program to perform all the cool programming stuff you need? Well, that's what RedPoint aims to be.

## About
RedPoint rose from my need of a better, more stable, and more powerful version of [dsc.red](https://github.com/13-05/discord.RED). So, I archived *dsc.red*, and started from scratch. One command at a time.

## What's With the Name, Anyway?
- `redpoint`: a cooler name alternative for `dsc.red` I had lying around.
- `.tool`: it's a multitool!

## Current Commands
1) Discord Webhook Spammer
2) Discord Webhook Deleter
3) Discord UserID Lookup Tool
4) Discord Account Disabler
5) Discord Token Checker
6) Discord Nitro Bruteforcer
7) Paste.io generator
8) Website source code generator

## TODOs
1) Discord Token Logger Generator
2) Discord Commandline Client Mode
3) Discord Token Lookup (gathers info on someone by their token)
4) Discord Server Cloner

## Use
Download node_modules, package.json, package-lock.json, and index.js into a folder, then open command prompt, run "cd /folderpathtofile", then run "node index.js"
If the command fails you probably need to [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## The Future
I'll add as many features as I can to this thing, so stay tuned!

# RedPoint [![Cyber - Stuff](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cyber-Stuff-indianred)](https://13-05.github.io)
Have you ever wanted a tool to exploit multiple services? A single program to perform all the cool programming stuff you need? Well, that's what RedPoint aims to be.

## About
RedPoint rose from my need of a better, more stable, and more powerful version of [dsc.red](https://github.com/13-05/discord.RED). So, I archived *dsc.red*, and started from scratch. One command at a time.

## What's With the Name, Anyway?
- `redpoint`: a cooler name alternative for `dsc.red` I had lying around.
- `.m`: mobile; it works on multiple platforms, and is optimized for mobile!
- `.tool`: it's a multitool!

## Current Commands
1) Discord Webhook Spammer
2) Discord Webhook Deleter
3) Discord UserID Lookup Tool
4) Discord Account Disabler

7) Generic Webpage Cloner

## Other Commands I Might Add Soon; I at Least Have the Idea Down.
1) Discord Token Logger Generator

## Other Stuff To Note
RedPoint automatically notifies you of any updates :D

## The Future
